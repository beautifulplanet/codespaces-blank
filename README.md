# InstallerClaw (SafePaw)

**Secure, one-click deployer for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nicepkg/openclaw).**

We call it **InstallerClaw** because it is the install and deploy layer around OpenClaw: one perimeter (gateway + wizard) that handles auth, rate limiting, scanning, TLS, and guided setup. The repo and paths still use **SafePaw** / `safepaw` for historical reasons; treat “InstallerClaw” as the product name and “SafePaw” as the codebase/organizational name.

**What it is:** A security perimeter (Go gateway + Go/React wizard) that wraps the OpenClaw personal AI assistant: reverse proxy with auth, rate limiting, prompt-injection and output scanning, TLS, and a guided setup UI. One command brings up the full stack; the wizard handles configuration and health monitoring.

**The trend we’re addressing:** Self-hosted AI assistants (OpenClaw, and similar local/private LLM front-ends) are popular. InstallerClaw is a safe, deployable perimeter for them—auth, scanning, and ops in one place—so you don’t expose the assistant without a guardrail layer.

### Non-goals / not a guarantee

- **Scanning is heuristic-only** — Pattern- and regex-based; it **reduces risk** of prompt injection and exfil, but does **not** guarantee prevention. Novel or obfuscated attacks may get through. Use defense-in-depth and treat scanning as one layer.
- **No silver bullet** — We document threats and mitigations in [THREAT-MODEL.md](beautifulplanet/safepaw/THREAT-MODEL.md). Residual risks remain (e.g. in-memory bans, heuristic limits). Suited for indie/small-team use; enterprise may need additional controls.

---

### Impact

- **Deploy in one command** — `docker compose up -d` from the [safepaw](beautifulplanet/safepaw) directory; five services (wizard, gateway, openclaw, redis, postgres) with health checks and internal-only backends.
- **All traffic through the gateway** — OpenClaw has no host-exposed ports. Auth, rate limiting, brute-force protection, and AI-defense scanning apply before any request reaches the assistant.
- **Wizard for ops** — React UI for admin login (session tokens, optional TOTP), prerequisites, live container status, and masked .env editing. Audit log for all admin actions.
- **258+ tests across gateway and wizard** — Go unit and integration tests, 7 fuzz targets, coverage gate (60%) in CI. Lint, gosec, govulncheck, Docker build on every push.
- **Operational docs** — Incident runbooks (6 types), backup/restore procedures, secret rotation, STRIDE threat model (27 threats). No “portfolio” framing — written for anyone running or evaluating the system.

**Stack:** Go · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind · Docker Compose · Redis · PostgreSQL · Prometheus · Grafana

### Evidence

| Claim | Proof |
|-------|--------|
| Stack runs locally | `cd beautifulplanet/safepaw && docker compose up -d` — wizard :3000, gateway :8080 |
| Gateway health | `curl -s http://localhost:8080/health` — returns status + backend reachability |
| Prometheus metrics | `curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics` — counters, histograms, gauges |
| 258+ Go tests | `cd beautifulplanet/safepaw/services/gateway && go test ./... -race`; same under `services/wizard` |
| 7 fuzz targets | `cd beautifulplanet/safepaw && make fuzz` (gateway middleware) |
| Vulnerability scan | `cd beautifulplanet/safepaw && make vulncheck` — govulncheck on both services |
| Incident runbooks | [RUNBOOK.md](beautifulplanet/safepaw/RUNBOOK.md) — token compromise, injection, gateway down, brute force, rotation, disk |
| Backup & recovery | [BACKUP-RECOVERY.md](beautifulplanet/safepaw/BACKUP-RECOVERY.md) — Postgres, Redis, volumes, .env |
| Threat model | [THREAT-MODEL.md](beautifulplanet/safepaw/THREAT-MODEL.md) — STRIDE, 27 threats, mitigations |

---

### Quality bar

- **Defense in depth** — Request path: metrics → headers → request ID → origin check → brute-force guard → rate limit → auth (HMAC + Redis revocation) → body scanner → output scanner → proxy. Each layer documented in [SECURITY.md](beautifulplanet/safepaw/SECURITY.md).
- **STRIDE threat model** — Documented threats and mitigations; residual risks called out (e.g. heuristic-only scanning, in-memory brute-force bans).
- **Backup and secret rotation** — Procedures for Postgres, Redis, volumes, and .env; RUNBOOK includes ordered secret rotation and one-shot rotation block.
- **CI pipeline** — Build, test (`-race`), lint (golangci-lint), gosec, govulncheck, coverage gate (60%), fuzz seed corpus, Docker build.
- **Structured logging** — Gateway: JSON or text via `LOG_FORMAT`; wizard: audit log for login, config changes, restarts. SIEM-ready.

# Part 1: Summary

_What this is, what it does, why it matters._

### What

SafePaw combines:

- **Go gateway** — Reverse proxy with HMAC auth, Redis-backed revocation, per-IP rate limiting, brute-force IP banning, 14-pattern prompt-injection body scanner, output scanner (XSS, secret leaks), security headers, origin validation, server-generated request IDs, optional TLS, Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logging.
- **Go + React wizard** — Single-binary setup UI (React embedded via `go:embed`): admin login with HMAC session tokens and optional TOTP, prerequisite checks (Docker, Compose, ports, disk), live container dashboard, masked .env edit, service restart, audit log.
- **Five-service Compose stack** — Wizard, gateway, OpenClaw, Redis, Postgres; only wizard and gateway exposed on the host (127.0.0.1). OpenClaw and data stores are internal only.

OpenClaw handles the AI assistant, channels (Discord, Telegram, Slack, etc.), and LLM integration. SafePaw handles the perimeter.

### Why it’s interesting (for reviewers)

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Security layering | Defense in depth with brute-force guard fed by auth failures and rate-limit hits; Redis-backed revocation; STRIDE threat model. |
| AI defense | Heuristic body scanner (14 patterns, versioned) + response/output scanner; risk levels and `X-SafePaw-Risk` header. |
| Zero-dependency choices | Gateway: no JWT library (custom HMAC tokens), no Redis client lib (minimal RESP client), no Docker SDK (raw Engine API over Unix socket). |
| Testing | 258+ tests, 7 fuzz targets, integration tests for auth/rate-limit/revocation/scope, coverage gate and govulncheck in CI. |
| Operations | Runbooks, backup/restore, secret rotation order, Grafana alerts, structured logging. |
| Wizard UX | Session tokens + optional TOTP, audit trail, prerequisite checks, live Docker status. |

### Key numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Go tests (gateway) | 195+ (middleware, config, integration, fuzz) |
| Go tests (wizard) | 63+ (session, TOTP, middleware, API, config, audit) |
| Fuzz targets | 7 (prompt injection, sanitize, channel, output scan, token, KV) |
| CI jobs | 5 (gateway build+test, wizard build+test, lint, security, Docker) |
| Runbook playbooks | 6 (token compromise, injection, gateway down, brute force, rotation, disk) |
| Threat model entries | 27 (STRIDE, all mitigated with residual risks noted) |
| Prometheus metrics | Request counts, durations, auth failures, injections, connection gauge, path normalization |

```

### Request flow

```
Request → Metrics → Security headers → Request ID (server UUID only)
        → Origin check → Brute-force guard → Rate limit → Auth (HMAC + revocation)
        → Body scanner (prompt injection) → Output scanner (XSS/secrets)
        → Reverse proxy → OpenClaw
```

### Key design decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| OpenClaw not exposed to host | Single security perimeter; all traffic is authenticated, rate-limited, and scanned. |
| Auth and revocation in gateway | Stateless HMAC tokens; revocation in Redis so it survives restarts and is shared across instances. |
| Wizard reads Docker socket read-only | Health and container list only; no privilege escalation from UI. |
| Heuristic-only AI scanning | No ML/LLM dependency; patterns versioned and auditable; documented as a limitation. |
| Server-generated request IDs only | Client X-Request-ID ignored to avoid log injection and guarantee unique correlation IDs. |

### Security posture

| Boundary | Threat | Mitigation | Status |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| Gateway API | Unauthenticated access | AUTH_ENABLED=true default in Docker; HMAC tokens, scope enforcement | ✅ |
| Gateway API | Token reuse after compromise | Redis-backed revocation; POST /admin/revoke | ✅ |
| Gateway API | Brute force / abuse | Rate limit + brute-force guard (IP ban after N failures) | ✅ |
| Gateway API | Prompt injection / exfil | Body scanner (14 patterns) + output scanner | ✅ Heuristic |
| Gateway API | Spoofed identity when auth off | StripAuthHeaders removes X-Auth-Subject/Scope | ✅ |
| Wizard admin | Weak or missing password | Auto-generated secret if unset; strong password in .env recommended | ✅ |
| Wizard admin | Session replay | HMAC session tokens with jti (nonce) | ✅ |
| Wizard admin | Credential stuffing | Optional TOTP (WIZARD_TOTP_SECRET); rate limit + delay on fail | ✅ |
| Config | Secret leak in UI | .env keys masked in GET; PUT restricted to allowed list | ✅ |
| Operations | Data loss | BACKUP-RECOVERY.md; RUNBOOK secret rotation | ✅ Documented |

# Part 3: Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (v2)
- Ports 3000 (wizard) and 8080 (gateway) free
- For production: set `AUTH_ENABLED=true`, `AUTH_SECRET`, and optionally `TLS_ENABLED` with certs

### Commands

```bash
# Clone (adjust URL if your repo differs)
git clone https://github.com/beautifulplanet/SafePaw.git
cd SafePaw/beautifulplanet/safepaw

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: API keys, channel tokens, AUTH_SECRET if using auth

# Launch
docker compose up -d

# Access
# Wizard:  http://localhost:3000   (password in docker compose logs wizard or set WIZARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD in .env)
# Gateway: http://localhost:8080  (proxies to OpenClaw)
```

First run: wizard prints an admin password once to stdout. Use `docker compose logs wizard` or set `WIZARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`.

From safepaw root: `make lint`, `make vulncheck`, `make fuzz`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](beautifulplanet/safepaw/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Testing

| Suite | Location | Command |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Gateway | `services/gateway` | `go test ./... -race` |
| Wizard | `services/wizard` | `go test ./... -race` |
| Fuzz (gateway) | `services/gateway` | `go test -fuzz=...` or `make fuzz` |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to do |
|-------|------------|
| Lost wizard admin password | `docker compose logs wizard` (first lines) or set `WIZARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` and restart. [SECURITY.md](beautifulplanet/safepaw/SECURITY.md) § Recovery. |
| Prerequisites fail | Install Docker and Compose; ensure 3000 and 8080 are free. |
| Dashboard shows no services | Wizard needs read-only Docker socket; check compose mount for `/var/run/docker.sock` (or npipe on Windows). |
| Gateway 502 / backend unreachable | OpenClaw may still be starting. `docker compose logs openclaw`; `curl http://localhost:8080/health`. |
| Auth required | Set `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and `AUTH_SECRET`; use `tools/tokengen` to create tokens. |

## Verify deployment

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health | jq .
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq .
```

Then open http://localhost:3000, sign in, and check the dashboard. Full script: `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` in the safepaw directory.

## Limitations

- **Prompt-injection and output scanning** — Heuristic (regex/patterns) only; **reduces risk**, does not guarantee prevention. No ML/LLM. See [SECURITY.md](beautifulplanet/safepaw/SECURITY.md).
- **Token revocation** — Redis-backed when Redis is configured; in-memory fallback. Brute-force bans are in-memory only.
- **Wizard password** — No “forgot password” flow; recovery via logs or `.env` and restart.
- **Stack** — Docker-first; wizard expects Docker socket for health. No generic bare-metal install path.

**Release / packaging:** No versioned releases or installers are published yet. When going public: plan for versioned tags (e.g. `v0.1.0`), checksums for binaries, and optionally a single-command installer or `docker compose` image pinning. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](beautifulplanet/safepaw/CONTRIBUTING.md) for build and test commands.
